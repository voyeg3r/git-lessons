# Git Lessons

A project to help you master Git from the basics to advanced techniques, following a structured, lesson-by-lesson approach. This repository was inspired by a conversation where the goal was to guide a beginner through every aspect of Git until they could confidently use it as a tool for version control.

## Project Background

This project came about as part of a learning journey where I requested help from ChatGPT to teach Git from scratch. The idea was to cover everything, starting with creating repositories, staging, committing changes, branching, merging, and all the way to advanced Git concepts. Each lesson is designed to build upon the previous one, allowing for progressive, hands-on learning.

The goal is to document each day's lesson in Markdown format, so that each concept can be recorded and referred back to at any time. The repository structure serves as a living resource for both the author and anyone else looking to improve their Git skills.
